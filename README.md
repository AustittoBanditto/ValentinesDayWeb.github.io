# ðŸ’– Will You Be My Valentine? ðŸ’–

## About This Project

I made this little web page as a fun and sweet way to ask: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**  
It's simple, cute, and easy to customize. The page shows a heartfelt message, a nice image, and playful buttons to make the experience memorable (and a bit silly if you try to say "No"!).

## Features

- Minimal, clean HTML and CSS
- Playful "Yes" and "No" button logic (try clicking "No"!)
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- All images are embedded, so no external dependencies
- Easy to personalize for your own Valentine

## How to Use

1. **Open the Project**  
   Go into the code for this project, open it in your own directory with a coding application such as VSCode.

2. **Run the Code**  
   In VSCode, hit 'run' in the top, and run without debugging.

3. **View the Project**  
   Now you should be in! you can now view the Valintines Day project, and play with the features!

4. **Customize (Optional)**  
   - Change the message in the `<h1>` tag.
   - Swap out the image (replace the base64 string in the `src`).
   - Edit the button texts or add your own fun logic.

## Why I Made This

I wanted a creative way to show someone I care (my girlfriend), and coding was a great way to mix passion and love!  
It's also a nice little HTML/CSS/JS project to play with and share.
